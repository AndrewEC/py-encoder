Dictionaries
============

The available dictionaries for encoding and decoding are available in the **dictionaries** directory.
You can add more
custom or generated dictionaries by creating a new yaml file and adding it to the **dictionaries** folder.

Once added
you can run a command like::

    python run.py encode string --help

and get a list of available dictionaries that can be supplied with the **-d** argument.
